Given a string, s, matching the regular expression [A-Za-z !,?._'@]+, split the string into tokens.
We define a token to be one or more consecutive English alphabetic letters. Then, print the number of tokens, followed by each token on a new line.

Note: You may find the String.split method helpful in completing this challenge.

Input Format
A single string, s.

Output Format
On the first line, print an integer, n, denoting the number of tokens in string s (they do not need to be unique).
Next, print each of the n tokens on a new line in the same order as they appear in input string s.

Sample Input
He is a very very good boy, isn't he?

Sample Output
10
He
is
a
very
very
good
boy
isn
t
he

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = scan.nextLine();
        // Write your code here.
        String[] tokens = s.trim().split("[^A-Za-z]+");
        
        if (s.trim().isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println(0);
        } 
        else {
            System.out.println(tokens.length);
            for (String token : tokens) {
                System.out.println(token);
            }
        }
        scan.close();
    }
}
