For this problem, we have 2 types of queries you can perform on a List:
Insert y at index x:
Insert
x y

Delete the element at index x:
Delete
x
Given a list, L, of N integers, perform Q queries on the list. Once all queries are completed, print the modified list as a single line of space-separated integers.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer, N (the initial number of elements in L).
The second line contains N space-separated integers describing L.
The third line contains an integer, Q (the number of queries).
The 2Q subsequent lines describe the queries, and each query is described over two lines:
If the first line of a query contains the String Insert, then the second line contains two space-separated integers x y, and the value y must be inserted into L at index x.
If the first line of a query contains the String Delete, then the second line contains index x, whose element must be deleted from L.

Output Format
Print the updated list L as a single line of space-separated integers.

Sample Input
5
12 0 1 78 12
2
Insert
5 23
Delete
0

Sample Output
0 1 78 12 23
