The elements of a String are called characters. The number of characters in a String is called the length, and it can be retrieved with the String.length() method.
Given two strings of lowercase English letters, A and B, perform the following operations:
Sum the lengths of A and B.
Determine if A is lexicographically larger than B (i.e.: does B come before A in the dictionary?).
Capitalize the first letter in A and B and print them on a single line, separated by a space.

Input Format
The first line contains a string A. The second line contains another string B. The strings are comprised of only lowercase English letters.

Output Format
There are three lines of output:
For the first line, sum the lengths of A and B.
For the second line, write Yes if A is lexicographically greater than B otherwise print No instead.
For the third line, capitalize the first letter in both A and B and print them on a single line, separated by a space.

        int sum = A.length()+B.length();      
        System.out.println(sum);
        if (A.compareTo(B) > 0) {
            System.out.println("Yes");
        } else {
            System.out.println("No");
        }
        String a = A.substring(0,1).toUpperCase() + A.substring(1);
        String b = B.substring(0, 1).toUpperCase() + B.substring(1);
        System.out.println(a+" "+b);
        
    }
}
