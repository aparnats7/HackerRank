Sometimes it’s better to use dynamic size arrays. Java’s ArrayList can provide you this feature. Try to solve this problem using Arraylist.
You are given n lines. In each line there are zero or more integers. You need to answer a few queries where you need to tell the number located in y<sup>th</sup> position of x<sup>th</sup> line.
Take your input from System.in.

Input Format
The first line has an integer n. In each of the next n lines there will be an integer d denoting number of integers on that line and then there will be d space-separated integers. In the next line there will be an integer q denoting number of queries. Each query will consist of two integers x and y.

Output Format
In each line, output the number located in y<sup>th</sup> position of x<sup>th</sup> line. If there is no such position, just print "ERROR!"

Sample Input
5
5 41 77 74 22 44
1 12
4 37 34 36 52
0
3 20 22 33
5
1 3
3 4
3 1
4 3
5 5

Sample Output
74
52
37
ERROR!
ERROR!
